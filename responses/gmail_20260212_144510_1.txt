Subject: Re: Question about your pricing plans - TechStartup Inc. Enterprise Inquiry

Dear P.J.,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our enterprise plan for TechStartup Inc. We're happy to discuss how our solutions can benefit your team of 50 employees.

Enterprise pricing is indeed customized based on specific needs and user count, and we absolutely offer attractive discounts for annual billing. To provide you with the most accurate monthly cost, a comprehensive breakdown of the features included in the enterprise tier (and how they differ from the pro plan), and a tailored quote, I recommend a quick chat with one of our enterprise specialists. They can walk you through all the details immediately.

Please let me know your preferred contact method or availability, and I will connect you with a specialist who can provide all the detailed information you require promptly.

Best regards,

[Your Name/Company Sales Team]
