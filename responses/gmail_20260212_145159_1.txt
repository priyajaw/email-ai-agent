Hi Priya,

Thanks for the quick recap and confirming the Q1 planning details. We've noted the critical deadlines, especially the **February 20th due date for final designs** and the March 1st marketing campaign launch.

We are actively prioritizing these design requirements to ensure we meet the deadline. My team is fully aligned, and we will keep you updated on our progress.

Best,

[Your Name]
