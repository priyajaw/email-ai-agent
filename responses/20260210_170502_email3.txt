Hello Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our product and pricing plans.

Our enterprise tier pricing is customized to best fit the unique needs of each organization, factoring in aspects like scale, specific features, and dedicated support requirements. To provide you with the most accurate information and a tailored quote, we typically need to understand a bit more about your company's specific needs and goals.

Would you be open to a brief call sometime next week to discuss your requirements in more detail? Alternatively, please feel free to share more details via email, and I'd be happy to answer any additional questions you might have.

Best regards,
